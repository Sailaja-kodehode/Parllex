      <h2>Delhi</h2>
      
        <br />If you’re spending any time in Northern India, you will almost certainly visit the capital city of Delhi.
         The enormous sprawling destination is home to several districts, and it is considered to be one of the oldest cities in the world. 
         One of the top sights in Delhi is the Red Fort, or Lal Qila, which was built in the 17th century.
        The Red Fort is made from sandstone, and you will be able to walk through its Lahore Gate, into the bazaar, through the jewel palace and even into the former residence of the sultan. While in Delhi, you should also make time for the many museums and religious structures that make up the city.

      <h2>Agra</h2>
      <p>
        <abbr title="spectacularly beautiful:Taj Mahal"></abbr>
        Agra is one of the most-visited cities in all of India. Once the capital
        of the Mughal Empire, Agra is now home to the iconic structure known as
        the Taj-Mahal. The white marble mausoleum was built in the 17th century,
        and it is widely regarded as a monument of love. While spectacularly
        beautiful, the TajMahal can be very crowded. Also worth seeing in Agra
        is the Agra Fort, which is very similar to the Red Fort of Delhi. You
        can tour this 16th century fort and even explore the interior of its
        beautiful palace.

         These 34 cave shrines are up to 1,500 years old, and they are from three distinct religions: Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism.
         Two hours away is Ajanta, which is also home to 29 caves. The Ajanta caves are covered in murals and paintings, most of which reflect Buddhist stories. While the two cave complexes are two hours away from one another, it is well worth visiting both to compare these incredible attractions.
